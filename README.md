## 🎯 Project Overview

This project performs a comprehensive **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** on a Student Performance dataset to identify the critical factors that impact academic outcomes. Using **Pandas** for data manipulation and **NumPy** for numerical computations, the analysis explores trends, correlations, and performance patterns across multiple variables.

### 🔍 Key Analysis Areas
- Study time and academic performance correlation
- Attendance patterns and their impact
- Parental education influence
- Test score distributions and trends
- Performance predictors identification
